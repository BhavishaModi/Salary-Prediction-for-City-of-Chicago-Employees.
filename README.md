# Salary-Prediction-for-City-of-Chicago-Employees.

This project aims to develop and deploy a salary prediction application which businessâ€™ HR and talent acquisition can use to optimize their compensation strategy, acquire the best talent, and improve retention rate in the competitive labor market. It answers the question of what is an optimal salary range based on different factors such as job title, department, full time or part time, salary based or hourly based, etc.

# Dataset Information
The dataset is split into 1. Training data 2. Testing data - Salary. There are ~33000 observations and 4 features in total.

# Features

Job Title: many positions are given

Department: 36 departments

Full-Time or Part-Time: 2 category

Salary based or Hourly based: 2 category

# Background

This notebook demonstrates the entire data science process of building a predictive model that can hypothetically be used by HR to estimate prospective employees' compensation based on Job Title. The processes involving defining the problem, preprocessing data, EDA, developing model, and deploying into production have been divided into main sections. The salary range tends to vary, depending on many factors such as job titles, department, full time or part time, salary based or hourly based, etc. This predictive analysis aims to build a scalable and deployable model to predict salary. Here is the breakdown of my project.

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, checking for outliers, missing data.

2. Exploratory data analysis to examine the distribution of the target variable and its correlation with categorical and numerical features.

3. Baseline Model - Linear Regression 

4. Find out lowest Mean Square Error (MSE) and higher R^2.

    Linear Regression : 

5. Feature importance data visualization

6. Deploy and save the final model into production using Pipeline.
